Note: when installing Opal Kelly python lib on a fresh install, note that `vcredist_x64` must be run in order to properly import the module (i.e. `import ok`)!

2018/03/10 -- Confirmed to work on:
- Windows 10
- FrontPanel (x64) v4.5.6
- Python 2.7.14
- wxPython (x86) v2.9.4.0
- VCredist (which versions??)
